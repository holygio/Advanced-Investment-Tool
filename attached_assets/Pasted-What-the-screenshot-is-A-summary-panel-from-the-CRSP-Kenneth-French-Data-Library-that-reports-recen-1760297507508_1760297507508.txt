What the screenshot is

A summary panel from the CRSP/Kenneth French Data Library that reports recent realized returns for:

Fama/French factors (FF3 and FF5 2×3 construction), and

Fama/French research portfolios (size×book, size×profitability, size×investment).

It shows three horizons for each row:

“August 2025” → the latest monthly return (1-month),

“Last 3 Months” → cumulative return over the most recent 3 months, and

“Last 12 Months” → cumulative return over the most recent 12 months.

Important format note on the page: CRSP switched from FIZ to CIZ in Jan 2025.

Legacy (FIZ): monthly return = month-to-month holding period return (HPR).

New (CIZ): monthly return = compounded daily returns with dividends reinvested on ex-dates.
⇒ The time aggregation and dividend timing changed. Keep that in mind if comparing pre-2025 vs post-2025.

What each block contains (and how to interpret)
A) Fama/French 3 Research Factors

Rm-Rf: Market excess return (broad equity premium)

SMB: Small minus Big (size premium)

HML: High minus Low (value premium)

Each cell is a percentage return for the stated horizon.

Usage: sanity-check signs & magnitudes before regressions; recent HML negative/flat is common; SMB often regime-dependent.

B) Fama/French 5 Research Factors (2×3)

Rm-Rf, SMB, HML (as above)

RMW: Robust minus Weak (profitability premium)

CMA: Conservative minus Aggressive (investment premium)

“2×3” indicates the construction via 2 size buckets × 3 characteristic buckets for each factor portfolio.

Usage: when you run FF5 regressions, these are the realized premia you can compare your estimated 
𝜆
^
λ
^
s against, or use to benchmark recent periods.

C) Fama/French Research Portfolios (sorted portfolios used in empirical tests)
Size × Book-to-Market (Value)

Small Value / Small Neutral / Small Growth

Big Value / Big Neutral / Big Growth

Expectation: Value > Growth in many long samples, but can reverse in recent windows.

Size × Operating Profitability

Small Robust / Small Neutral / Small Weak

Big Robust / Big Neutral / Big Weak

Expectation: Robust profitability outperforms weak.

Size × Investment

Small Conservative / Small Neutral / Small Aggressive

Big Conservative / Big Neutral / Big Aggressive

Expectation: Conservative investment outperforms aggressive.

Usage: These can be your “test assets”

 for CAPM/FF3/FF5/GRS demonstrations. Their loadings line up with the factor logic (e.g., Small Value should load +HML, +SMB).

How to encode this for your app (tidy schema)

Create a compact CSV/JSON so the UI can load a “benchmark panel” without scraping:

Option 1 — Long (tidy) format CSV

date, panel, item, horizon, value
2025-08-31, FF3, Rm-Rf, 1m, 1.85
2025-08-31, FF3, SMB,  1m, 3.87
2025-08-31, FF3, HML,  1m, 4.41
2025-08-31, FF5, RMW,  1m, -0.69
2025-08-31, FF5, CMA,  1m, 2.07
2025-08-31, Size-BM, Small Value, 1m, 9.24
... (repeat for 3m, 12m)


panel ∈ {FF3, FF5, Size-BM, Size-Prof, Size-Inv}

item = factor name or portfolio name

horizon ∈ {1m, 3m, 12m}

value = percentage return (keep as % for display; convert to decimal when computing)

Option 2 — Two CSVs

current_factors.csv (FF3 & FF5)

current_portfolios.csv (research portfolios)
Same columns as above.

QA checks for loader

Coerce % strings to float.

Ensure date parsed to ISO (e.g., 2025-08-31).

Validate enumerations (panel/items); raise clear errors.

How to use this data in your module (practical hooks)

Benchmark panel (top-right card)

Show latest 1m / 3m / 12m factor returns side-by-side with your estimated factor means from the uploaded Ken French CSVs.

Visual: grouped bar chart (Estimated vs Current Research).

Tooltip: “CRSP CIZ post-2025 are compounded daily with dividends on ex-dates.”

Regression sanity check

When you run FF3/FF5 regressions on your test assets, render an “alpha context” chart comparing:

Your model’s fitted factor contributions (using sample means)

vs. the recent Current Research premia product to highlight short-term divergences.

GRS interpretation aid

After computing GRS F & p-value, annotate with the current horizon premia:

If GRS rejects, show which test portfolios have large 
∣
𝛼
∣
∣α∣ and whether that aligns with the recent factor headwinds/tailwinds from the benchmark table.

Case selection

Let users pick which research portfolios (e.g., Small Value, Big Growth) to include as test assets.

Pre-fill expected loadings in the UI help text: e.g., “Small Value → +SMB, +HML; Big Growth → −HML.”

Implementation notes for the AI agent

Units: the screenshot numbers are percent returns. Store as % for display; divide by 100 only when combining with other decimal series.

Aggregation: “Last 3 Months/12 Months” are cumulative returns. If you present annualized, show the method:

Ann. 12m
=
(
1
+
cum12m
)
(
12
/
12
)
−
1
=
cum12m
Ann. 12m=(1+cum12m)
(12/12)
−1=cum12m (since it’s already 12m); for 3m, optionally annualize via 
(
1
+
cum3m
)
4
−
1
(1+cum3m)
4
−1.

Comparability warning: display a small banner if your sample spans pre-2025 (FIZ) and post-2025 (CIZ): “Methodology changed in 2025; do not directly compare across the break without caution.”

Suggested UI blocks

TheoryCard: FF3 / FF5 formulas & factor definitions (one-liners each).

Benchmark Widget: compact table of 1m/3m/12m for FF3 & FF5 (sortable).

Heatmap: correlations among factors (from your CSVs), not from the screenshot.

Alpha Bar Chart: α by portfolio for FF3 vs FF5; overlay GRS verdict.

Example loader (pseudocode)
def load_current_research(file_path: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    # expected columns: date, panel, item, horizon, value
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
    # keep % units; convert to decimals only when computing
    # pivot helpers:
    benchmark_1m = df[df.horizon=='1m'].pivot(index=['panel','item'], columns='date', values='value')
    return df, benchmark_1m

How this helps your app

Gives users contextual, up-to-date realized premia to interpret model outputs.

Strengthens the “theory → data → validation” story: show formulas, estimate models, then benchmark against real, recent factor returns.

Makes the GRS result more intuitive: if factors have been weak/strong recently, you can narrate why some α’s appear.
