🧠 Replit AI Agent Prompt
🎯 TASK:
Update the portfolio optimization app to use a **static dataset (10 years of daily prices)** for 10 predefined tickers.
Remove all live API calls or yfinance downloads inside the Replit app — it must load data locally from a CSV file.

---

### DETAILS

1️⃣ **Static Dataset**
- The data file is `data/prices_10y.csv`, already uploaded to the project.
- It contains Adjusted Close prices from **2015-01-01 to 2025-01-01**.
- The tickers (columns) are:
  SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, TLT, HYG, GLD, SLV, UUP, VIXY.

2️⃣ **Load Logic**
Create a function (or modify the existing `load_static_prices()` in `data.py`) that:
```python
def load_static_prices():
    """
    Load static dataset of 10 assets (2015–2025).
    Users can choose any subset of these tickers for optimization,
    but cannot use others outside this list.
    """


Loads the file: data/prices_10y.csv

Parses dates properly (parse_dates=True, index_col=0)

Returns a pandas DataFrame of shape [~2500 rows × 10 columns].

3️⃣ Portfolio Configuration (10 years only)

Change any “lookback period” or “years” configuration from 20 years → 10 years.

Update any UI or config text to read:

“Data covers the last 10 years (2015–2025) for 10 pre-selected ETFs.”

Disable any inputs that try to fetch or extend data beyond 10 years.

4️⃣ User Interface / Instructions

In the UI (CLI prompt or web interface), add a visible note:

“You can build portfolios using any subset of these 10 tickers:
SPY, QQQ, IWM, XLF, TLT, HYG, GLD, SLV, UUP, VIXY.
Other tickers are not available in this offline version.”

Allow users to select fewer than 10 tickers (e.g., choose 4 or 5),
but the available tickers list must remain fixed.

5️⃣ Performance Optimization

Make sure data loading is instant (<2 seconds).

Remove all network requests (no yfinance, TwelveData, Finnhub, etc.).

If any data-fetch functions exist, disable or comment them out.

6️⃣ Testing

Verify load_static_prices() works by printing shape and column names.

Ensure the optimizer and plotting functions use this dataset only.

Confirm that the app cannot crash if a user selects fewer than 10 tickers.

DELIVERABLE

A fully working version of the portfolio optimization app that:
✅ Loads prices from data/prices_10y.csv
✅ Works offline (no external API)
✅ Limits users to the 10 specified tickers
✅ Uses only the last 10 years of data
✅ Updates configuration/labels accordingly

📌 **Next step for you:**
Paste this prompt directly into the **Replit AI Agent chat**.  
It will:
- Replace the data-fetching logic with a static loader,  
- Adjust configuration from 20→10 years,  
- Add user guidance about the fixed tickers.
