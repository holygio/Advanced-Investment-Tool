🧠 Prompt for Replit AI Agent
Build Module: “Information & Global Markets Lab”

(Lecture 7 – Advanced Investments, Oct 13 2025)

🎯 Objective

Create a new learning module called
/modules/information-lab/

This module teaches international diversification, home bias, and information asymmetry (Grossman model) using first-principles explanations and fully interactive offline simulations.

It must not fetch real data (no Yahoo Finance); all examples should use internally generated synthetic data or formulas.

🔹 PART 1 – THEORY SECTION

Implement this as /modules/information-lab/theory/page.tsx
It should render collapsible TheoryCards with LaTeX equations, plain-English explanations, and “So what?” takeaways.

Each card = one concept, shown in order.

🪙 1) Why Global Diversification Matters

Idea: Investors allocate wealth across countries to reduce portfolio volatility, because cross-country correlations are usually < 1.

So what?
The lower the correlation between domestic and foreign returns, the higher the diversification gain. But currency risk can offset this benefit if unmanaged.

🏠 2) The Home Bias Puzzle

Investors hold mostly domestic assets even though global diversification would improve the Sharpe ratio.

Main drivers:

Information asymmetry and familiarity bias

Institutional barriers and taxes

Perceived currency and political risk

So what?
Home-biased portfolios feel safer but are inefficient: lower expected return for higher risk.

🧩 3) Information & Grossman (1976)

): posterior uncertainty

ρ = information precision (signal correlation with truth)

So what?
More precise signals → investors take larger positions → market prices become more informative → incentives to gather info decrease (rational expectations equilibrium).

🧠 4) Rational Expectations & Market Efficiency

When investors optimally use available information, prices embed those beliefs.

Flow:

Private Signal → Portfolio Decision → Market Price → Belief Update → New Equilibrium


If signals are costly or correlated, equilibrium prices only partially reveal fundamentals.

So what?
Efficiency is relative: markets can be informationally efficient given costs and incentives.

🔄 5) Connection to Black–Litterman

Black–Litterman translates the Grossman idea into portfolio optimization:
private signals → views → posterior expected returns.

Output:

Plot portfolio σ vs ρ.

“Diversification Benefit = σ_H − σ_p” card.

Tooltip: “As ρ ↓, volatility ↓ → benefit ↑.”

🏠 2) Home Bias Visualizer

Sliders:

Home bias % (0 – 100)

Expected return gap Δμ (−0.02 → +0.02)

σ ratio (σ_H/σ_F = 0.5 → 2)

Compute: expected return, risk, Sharpe ratio.
Plot Sharpe ratio vs bias % and highlight global optimum.
Show message: “A 100% home bias reduces efficiency by X%.”

🧠 3) Grossman Model Simulator

Goal: Visualize how private signal quality and risk aversion shape equilibrium and information aggregation.

Sliders:

Parameter	Range	Explanation
ρ (signal precision)	0 → 1	correlation between signal and true value
a (risk aversion)	0.5 → 10	CARA parameter
C (info cost)	0 → 1	cost reduces active participation
N (investors)	1 → 20	number of agents in market

Backend computation (Python or JS):

import numpy as np

def grossman_model(rho, a, C, N):
    P_true = 100
    signals = P_true + np.random.normal(0, (1-rho)*5, N)
    Var_post = (1-rho**2)*25
    X = (signals - P_true) / (a*Var_post)
    X = X * (1 - C)  # info cost dampening
    P_eq = np.mean(signals - a*Var_post*X)
    info_index = rho * (1 - C)
    return X, P_eq, info_index


Outputs:

Line chart of price informativeness index vs ρ

Dynamic text: “At ρ = 0.8 and a = 2, price reflects ≈ 80% of private information.”

Add interactive explanations:

“Increasing ρ tightens beliefs → positions ↑ → price reflects more information.”
“Higher a or C reduces participation → prices less informative.”

🔄 4) Optional Black–Litterman Integration

Button: “Feed Signal into Black–Litterman”
When pressed, simulate a view Δμ = Signal × ρ and feed into the existing BL posterior:

💡 Pedagogical Outcome

This module closes the entire course cycle:

It turns the final lecture into a self-contained micro-market simulator and visual theory companion for the Grossman model, home bias, and global finance.
