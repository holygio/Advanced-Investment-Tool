🔧 Prompt — Enrich Theory Tab: Utility & SDF

Page: /theory/utility/page.tsx

Goal

Rebuild the Utility & SDF Theory tab in first-principles language, fully aligned with Lecture 5 (Sept 26, 2025). Cover: CARA/CRRA/DARA, marginal utility → SDF, stochastic dominance (FSD/SSD/TSD), CAPM vs SD, why/when MV is an approximation, SD-based SDFs, and LPM → M-LPM equilibrium. No data calls; render markdown with LaTeX.

1) Why Utility Matters for Pricing

Utility encodes risk preferences; its marginal utility shapes the SDF 
𝑚
m used in pricing:

1
=
𝐸
[
𝑚
𝑡
+
1
𝑅
𝑡
+
1
]
,
𝑚
𝑡

R

],m
t+1
	​

∝U
′
(C
t+1
	​

)

Risk aversion ⇒ 
𝑈
′
U
′
 declines with wealth; “bad states” (low 
𝐶
C) have high 
𝑚
m. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? All models (CAPM, multi-factor, LPM) imply a particular shape for 
𝑈
U and thus for 
𝑚
m. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

2) Traditional Utility Classes: CRRA, CARA, DARA

CRRA: 
𝑈

U(x)=

 (log when 
𝛾

γ=1); Relative RA

𝛾
=γ (constant).

CARA: 
𝑈
(
𝑥
)
=
−
𝑒
−
𝑏
𝑥
U(x)=−e
−bx
; Absolute RA 
=
𝑏
=b (constant).

DARA: e.g., 
𝑈
(
𝑥
)
=
ln
⁡
𝑥
U(x)=lnx; ARA decreases with wealth.

These summarize risk attitude when SDF isn’t explicit. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? Curvature of 
𝑈
U ⇒ strength of risk aversion and SDF slope.

CAPM requires investing “in everything” so 
𝑅

M
	​

 tracks wealth/consumption risk. Real investors may have non-market exposures (home, human capital). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? CAPM is a linear approximation; richer SDFs allow non-linear state pricing. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

4) Stochastic Dominance (FSD → TSD)

FSD (non-satiation): 
𝑈
′
>
0
⇒
𝑚
>
0
U
′
>0⇒m>0.

SSD (risk aversion): 
𝑈
′
′
<
0
⇒
𝑚
U
′′
<0⇒m decreasing.

TSD (skewness pref.): 
𝑈
′
′
′
>
0
⇒
𝑚
U
′′′
>0⇒m decreasing at a decreasing rate.

SD sets economically necessary sign/shape constraints on 
𝑚
m. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? SD generalizes MV beyond normality/quadratic utility. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

5) CAPM vs SD (Violations & Linear Limits)

CAPM SDF 
𝑚
=
𝑎
+
𝑏
𝑅
𝑀
m=a+bR
M
	​

 can satisfy risk aversion 
𝑏
<
0
b<0 but may violate non-satiation (negative 
𝑚
m in extremes).

MV implies quadratic 
𝑈
U → only locally valid; SD admits non-linear 
𝑚
m. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? CAPM/MV are useful approximations, fragile in tails. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

6) Why/When MV Still Useful

MV relies on (i) normal returns or (ii) quadratic 
𝑈
U.

By Taylor approx (Tsiang, 1972), it works over limited ranges; fails in extremes and can be FSD-dominated. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? Good baseline; upgrade when tails/skew matter. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

7) SD-Based SDFs (Descriptive Approach)

Estimate 
𝑚
m non-parametrically via 
𝐸
[
𝑚
𝑅
]
=
1
E[mR]=1; enforce 
𝑚
>
0
m>0, decreasing, etc.

Empirically shows strong aversion to large losses (~ −12%). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? Lets the data shape 
𝑚
m; some anomalies persist.

8) Lower Partial Moments (LPM) & M-LPM Equilibrium

Definition: 
𝐿

Under normality, MV ≈ LPM; in general, M-LPM yields an equilibrium SDF of form

,0) (risk-neutral above threshold). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Portfolio separation holds with a risk-free asset; efficient sets differ from MV. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…


So what? LPM focuses on downside risk, preserving non-satiation and risk aversion. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

9) ESG (Optional Theory Note)

ESG fits if/when it affects returns; factorizable (long high ESG − short low ESG).

Realized vs expected returns can diverge as flows move prices. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

UI notes: Render LaTeX; add ExplainTips for “non-satiation,” “negative 
𝑚
m,” and “LPM vs MV.”
Acceptance: All sections above present formulas + “So what?” lines, mirroring Lecture 5.

🔧 Prompt — Enrich Theory Tab: Fixed Income & Derivatives

Page: /theory/fixedincome/page.tsx

Goal

Rebuild the Fixed Income & Derivatives Theory tab in first-principles language, aligned with Lecture 6 (Oct 6, 2025). Cover: bonds’ payoff asymmetry, interest-rate risk (term structure, duration–convexity intuition), default risk (ratings, recovery, risk premia, CDO tranching), 5-factor (incl. TERM, CREDIT), stocks–bonds links, derivatives’ limits for SDF pricing, and risk-neutral probabilities. No data; markdown + LaTeX.

1) Why “Asset Pricing ≠ Only Stocks”

CAPM/MV apply in principle to all assets, but other asset classes have distinct risk drivers; bonds & derivatives deserve dedicated treatment. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? For a complete model/SDF, we must capture interest-rate and default risks, not just 
𝑅
𝑀
R
M
	​

. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

2) Bonds: Payoffs, Asymmetry, and Non-Linearity

Fixed coupons + principal; limited upside (single-digits), downside to −100%.

Non-linear price–yield relation; coupon reinvestment matters. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Risk is not symmetric; linear β intuition is fragile for rates. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

3) Interest-Rate Risk (Term Structure > Single YTM)

Bond price: 
𝑃

∑
𝑡
=
1
𝑇
coupon
𝑡
(
1
+
𝑟
𝑡
)
𝑡

)

	​

+
(1+r
T

)
T

	​

.

YTM is a single summary; reality is a vector of spot rates → term structure matters.

Sensitivity drivers: maturity (longer ⇒ more sensitive) and coupon (higher ⇒ less sensitive). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

Practical signal: term spread (10y–3m) is informative (FF 1993 link). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Rate moves are multi-tenor; use curve intuition, not just a scalar YTM.

Asymmetry: +100 bps vs −100 bps impacts are not equal (convexity). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Use duration–convexity for scenario sense-checking; be wary of large shocks. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

5) Default (Credit) Risk

Ratings (AAA…D) proxy PD; recovery matters; large investors often face IG constraints (BBB+); downgrades trigger flows. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

Prices reflect PD × LGD and a risk premium (non-linear; varies with rating).

Historical default rates and recession regimes explain spread cycles; risk premia are time-varying. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Credit spreads embed expected losses + risk compensation; both move with the cycle. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

6) Structured Credit (CDO Tranching)

Pool splits into equity, mezz, senior, super-senior; losses flow from bottom up.

Senior tranches can appear low-risk until correlation/regime shifts. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Tranching repackages default risk; systemic correlation is the Achilles’ heel.

7) A Unified 5-Factor SDF (Stocks + Bonds)

Early FF (1993) includes TERM and CREDIT alongside MKT/SMB/HML:

TERM = long − short gov’t returns; CREDIT = corp − gov’t returns.

Stocks and bonds are linked through discounting (rates) and distress (credit). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Cross-asset SDF needs both curve and credit to price broad portfolios. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

8) Derivatives: Why SDF Pricing Is Limited in Practice

In principle, same SDF; in practice, hedge ratios (deltas) change continuously → option “β” is time-varying and highly non-linear.

SDF approaches suit longer-horizon investments, not fast-changing derivatives exposures. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Use SDF for risk pricing intuition; value options via no-arbitrage machinery.

9) Risk-Neutral Probabilities (Educational Bridge)

In a one-step binomial:

𝐸

Q
	​

=
u−d
(1+r
f
	​

)−d
	​


These risk-neutral 
𝑝
𝑄
p
Q
	​

 are not physical probabilities but are forward-looking from option prices. Shifts in 
𝑝
𝑄
p
Q
	​

 can reveal regime changes. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Options encode state prices; great for extracting market-implied scenarios. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…

10) Performance & Portfolio Construction Notes (Cross-links)

Hedge funds/market timing: exposures and premia are time-varying; evaluation metrics can swing with regimes.

Hierarchical portfolios: re-optimize at the total level; Treynor for well-diversified sleeves vs total σ when sleeves aren’t. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Oc…


So what? Always look top-down across asset classes; cross-correlations matter.

Acceptance: Each card includes formulas + plain English + a one-line “So what?”, aligned with Lecture 6 emphasis.
