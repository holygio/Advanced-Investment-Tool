That visualization technically works, but pedagogically it fails to make the concepts click. It looks like a noisy time series rather than an insight. It tells you “the SDF fluctuates,” but not why, how much, or what it means.

Let’s unpack what’s wrong — and then I’ll outline exactly how to fix it so that the Utility & SDF module becomes intuitive, beautiful, and educational.

🚫 Why This Current View Isn’t Effective

The SDF line plot is too abstract.
You see two wiggly lines (CRRA and CAPM), but unless someone already knows what “high m in bad states” means, they learn nothing from it.

No connection to states of the world or pricing.
There’s a red shading for “recessions,” but you can’t see how that links to asset payoffs or expected returns. The SDF concept — “higher in bad times → lower required returns” — remains verbal, not visual.

No intuition about curvature.
The power of utility-based pricing is in curvature — how marginal utility responds to consumption shocks. That curvature is invisible in this noisy time path.

The metrics above (Mean SDF, Volatility, Avg Pricing Error) are correct, but isolated — they don’t teach what happens when γ or σₙ changes.
You can’t feel the risk aversion effect.

🧠 What the Module Should Actually Teach

The Utility & SDF module should help the student see four key insights:

Concept	What the user should see
1. Utility curvature	Steeper 
𝑈
′
(
𝑥
)
U
′
(x) means more risk aversion.
2. Risk pricing	Higher γ → SDF spikes in bad states → safer assets valued more.
3. Link to CAPM	The linear CAPM SDF is just an approximation of the true utility SDF.
4. Pricing intuition	The dot product 
𝐸
[
𝑚
𝑅
]
E[mR] ≈ 1 connects SDF & returns visually.
💡 How to Fix It (Redesign Plan)
🟩 A. Replace the “noisy line” view with a State-Price Diagram

Instead of a 240-month time path, generate a scatter or joint density plot:

X-axis = consumption growth Δc

Y-axis = SDF (utility-based and CAPM-based)

Color = probability density

Draw fitted lines for both models (CRRA → convex; CAPM → linear)

→ The student instantly sees that the SDF is high when Δc is low (bad states).

Optional overlay:
Shade the right tail (booms) with “cheap states” and left tail (recessions) with “expensive states.”
Label them directly:

“High m → payoffs valued more → lower expected returns.”

🟨 B. Add a γ (risk aversion) animation slider

When the user drags γ:

The curvature of the CRRA SDF steepens.

CAPM line stays almost linear.

Pricing error metric below updates live.

This immediately shows:

“Higher γ exaggerates bad-state pricing → higher equity premium.”

🟥 C. Add a “Two-Asset Pricing Panel”

Under the chart, show two synthetic assets:

Asset	Payoff pattern	Expected return	Beta	Price
Safe bond	constant	2%	0	1.00
Risky asset	rises with Δc	6%	1	0.96

Then compute and display:

1
−
𝐸
[
𝑚
𝑅
𝑖
]
1−E[mR
i
	​

]

for each, with a visual indicator (green = well-priced, red = mispriced).
→ The student sees how SDF explains prices.

🟦 D. Add a Dual-Panel Layout

Top: static relationship (SDF vs Δc).
Bottom: dynamic decomposition (expected return = risk-free + risk premium).

This converts the messy stochastic path into a clear economic story.

🧮 E. Backend Adjustments

Simulate smaller data, e.g. 5,000 draws of (Δc, R_m):

Δc = np.random.normal(0.002, σ_c, N)
m_utility = β * (1 + Δc)**(-γ)
m_capm = 1 - b * R_m


Sort by Δc, average by bins, and return a clean, smoothed SDF relation.

🖼️ F. Frontend Changes

Replace time-series plot with Scatter + Fit Line plot using Plotly.

Add animation for γ and σ_c.

Add “state price” hover labels.

Keep KPI cards but make them reactive to sliders.

Rename the chart:

“State Prices and Risk Aversion: Utility-based vs CAPM SDF”

🧭 G. Theory Card (improved)

Understanding the SDF

Each dot represents a possible “state of the world,” with consumption growth on the x-axis and its “price” (SDF) on the y-axis.

The slope of the SDF curve captures the price of risk.

Under CAPM, this slope is linear and constant.

Under utility theory (CRRA), curvature matters — bad states become disproportionately valuable when risk aversion γ increases.

Assets that pay in bad states have negative covariance with m, hence lower expected return.
