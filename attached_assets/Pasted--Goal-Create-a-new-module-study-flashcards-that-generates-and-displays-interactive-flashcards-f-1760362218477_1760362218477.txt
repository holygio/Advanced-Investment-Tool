🎯 Goal

Create a new module /study/flashcards/ that generates and displays interactive flashcards from past exam questions and practice Q&A documents (all PDFs provided).
Each card should show a question, an optional hint, and a flip-to-reveal answer section with formulas and short explanations.

📁 Source Files

Use all uploaded PDFs:

🧠 Core Features
1️⃣ Flashcard Extraction Logic

Automatically parse questions/answers from PDF text into JSON structure:

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "topic": "CAPM",
    "question": "Explain the difference between systematic and unsystematic risk.",
    "hint": "Think about diversification.",
    "answer": "Systematic risk is market-wide, cannot be diversified away. Unsystematic is firm-specific and diversifiable."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "topic": "Anomalies",
    "question": "What is the size effect anomaly?",
    "answer": "Small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-cap stocks even after adjusting for risk, violating CAPM predictions."
  }
]


Use topic tagging heuristics (keyword detection):

“CAPM”, “beta”, “market premium” → CAPM

“anomalies”, “momentum”, “size”, “value” → Anomalies

“risk”, “variance”, “skewness” → Risk

“utility”, “SDF”, “marginal utility” → Utility

“portfolio”, “frontier”, “Sharpe” → Portfolio

“bonds”, “duration”, “term structure” → Fixed Income

2️⃣ Flashcard Interface

3D flip animation (Framer Motion)

Show question on front, answer on back

Top bar filters by topic and difficulty

“Shuffle”, “Mark as Known”, “Retry” buttons

“Quiz Mode”: hides answers until clicked

3️⃣ Topic Filtering & Quiz Mode

Dropdown filter by topic or year (based on PDF name)

Optional toggle for random order

Quiz Mode: multiple-choice generation (AI-generated from same answer set)

Show 1 correct + 3 distractors

4️⃣ User Progress Tracking (localStorage)

Save known/unknown questions

Display progress bar (% mastered per topic)

5️⃣ File-Based Dataset

/data/flashcards.json is automatically built when you upload new PDFs

Can regenerate via npm run extract:flashcards

Extraction script:

/scripts/extract_flashcards.py


This script uses regex to split Q&A patterns like:

“Question X: … Answer: …”

“Q:” / “A:”

“Explain…” / “Because…”
It then deduplicates, tags, and formats into the JSON schema.

🧩 UI Design

Use Card, Button, and Badge from shadcn/ui

Tailwind + Framer Motion for animations

Use theme colors consistent with your other modules (white/gold accent)

Add “Study Mode” and “Exam Mode” tabs:

Study Mode: view one flashcard at a time with explanations.

Exam Mode: multiple-choice quiz; display score at end.

🧪 Example Flashcard Render

Front:

Question (CAPM, 2017 Exam)
“What are the main assumptions underlying the CAPM?”

Back:

Investors are rational mean–variance optimizers

Homogeneous expectations

Risk-free borrowing/lending

Market portfolio is mean–variance efficient

All assets are traded
So what? → All investors hold market + risk-free asset.
