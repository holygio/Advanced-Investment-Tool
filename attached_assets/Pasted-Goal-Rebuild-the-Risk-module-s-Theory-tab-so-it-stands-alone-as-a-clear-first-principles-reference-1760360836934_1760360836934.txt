Goal

Rebuild the Risk module’s Theory tab so it stands alone as a clear, first-principles reference aligned with Advanced Investments — Lecture 4. Include:

Empirical distribution facts & horizon/scaling issues

Normality diagnostics (skew, kurtosis, Jarque–Bera)

Higher-moment preferences/pricing (skewness, kurtosis; utility/SDF view)

Risk & performance metrics (Sharpe, Treynor, Information Ratio, Jensen’s α, M²)

Expectations & Black-Litterman (brief)

Tie-ins to testing (sorted portfolios, GRS pointer)

No data calls; render as markdown “TheoryCards” with LaTeX.

Page: /theory/risk/page.tsx

Render the following collapsible cards in order. Use LaTeX for formulas, short bullets for intuition, and an “ExplainTip” icon for each tricky concept.

1) Why Risk Measurement Matters (First Principles)

Idea: Portfolio choice and evaluation both require a quantitative map from randomness to decisions. Risk is not one thing: its definition depends on distribution shape, investor preferences, and horizon. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

So what? If you change the horizon or the shape assumption (normal vs heavy-tailed), the “best” portfolio and the “best” manager can change. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

2) Empirical Return Distributions & Horizon

Returns are not frequency-invariant: means, variances, correlations, and higher moments change with sampling (daily vs weekly vs monthly). Risk does not scale neatly with √time in practice. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Returns are multiplicative; the product of normals is not normal → compounding creates skew/fat tails even when log-returns are close to normal. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Takeaway: Portfolio weights and “optimality” are sensitive to horizon and distributional assumptions—expect different efficient sets across frequencies.

3) Normality: What It Implies and Why It Fails

Why the Normal is popular: Two parameters 
(
𝜇
,
𝜎
2
)
(μ,σ
2
) summarize the entire distribution → gives the mean–variance framework. It’s one of two main routes to MV (the other is quadratic utility). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

But in data: Financial returns often show asymmetry (skew) and fat tails (excess kurtosis), especially at higher frequencies.

Interpretation: large JB → reject normality. Expect frequent rejections in finance. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

So what? If normality fails, variance alone misses risk; investors may care about downside and tail behavior. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

4) Higher Moments in Preferences & Pricing

Motivation: Investors typically dislike negative skew and dislike excess kurtosis. Classic extensions (Kraus–Litzenberger, Harvey–Siddique, Dittmar): add skew/kurt moments to utility/SDF. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

SDF adjustment (concept):
General pricing identity 
1
=
𝐸
[
𝑚
𝑅
]
1=E[mR]. With higher-moment preferences, the SDF 
𝑚
m becomes a function of shocks beyond the market factor (captures skew/kurt aversion). (Slides reference the idea and Dittmar-style formulations.) 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Implication: In cross-section tests, assets that worsen left tails require extra premium; those that hedge bad states earn less. Efficient set balancing return/variance/skew/kurt is more complex than MV. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

So what? When tails matter, MV optimality is not sufficient; downside and tail metrics (like LPM, co-skew) become directly relevant.

5) Downside Risk & LPM (link to Practice)

(Short theory anchor for your LPM frontier in Practice.)

n
]

Semivariance is 
𝐿

(

LPM

(0).

Interpretation: Focuses only on bad outcomes (below 
𝜏
τ), matching investor loss aversion.

Frontier: When you minimize LPM
2
(
𝜏
)
2
	​

(τ) for a given expected return, you get a Return–LPM efficient frontier (generally differs from MV).

So what? LPM reframes “risk” as bad-tail mass rather than total variance—aligns better with non-normal returns and left-tail fear. (Slides emphasize non-normality and higher-moment preferences.)

); then compare levels in percent return. It’s a Sharpe-to-percent mapping and naturally compares active vs passive. (Lecture’s “formula of the week”.) 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

So what? Use Sharpe when total risk matters, Treynor when beta is the constraint, IR/Jensen for benchmarked skill, and M² when you want an apples-to-apples percent return comparison at the benchmark’s risk. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

7) Expectations & Views: Black–Litterman (Brief Theory Anchor)

Historical means/covariances can be unstable; investors may hold views (subjective expected returns).

Black–Litterman blends equilibrium/benchmark returns with investor views, weighted by confidence, then runs the usual optimization. Best for asset-class allocation or small stock universes; less practical at full stock-level due to dimension. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

So what? Risk evaluation depends on expected returns too; BL offers a disciplined way to inject views before computing Sharpe/M², etc. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

8) Links to Testing (Where Risk Meets Evidence)

Sorted portfolios amplify signals and define long–short factors used in models; good for diagnosing whether risk measures line up with realized premia. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

GRS joint-alpha test (pointer): if a chosen risk model (e.g., MV+factors) is correct, all test-portfolio alphas should be zero jointly. Rejection ⇒ model missing risk dimensions (e.g., tails/downside). 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

9) Common Pitfalls (Callouts)

Sharpe with non-normal returns: can mislead when tails skew; consider IR, downside or LPM complements. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Horizon drift: comparing daily Sharpe to monthly Sharpe is not apples-to-apples. 

Advanced Investments Lecture Se…

Over-reliance on 
𝜇
μ: optimal weights overly sensitive to expected returns; use robust/Bayesian or BL.

UI/Copy Instructions

Implement each section as a TheoryCard with: header, 4–8 concise bullets, 1–3 equations, and a 1-line “So what?” takeaway.

Add ExplainTip icons for: horizon scaling, JB test, LPM vs variance, M² construction, BL confidence.

Keep everything offline (no charts/data fetch).

Acceptance Criteria

Theory tab covers: empirical distributions & horizon, normality & JB, higher-moment preferences/SDF idea, downside risk & LPM (bridge to Practice), full 5 metrics incl. M², expectations/BL, and testing pointers (sorted portfolios & GRS). All content matches Lecture 4 wording and emphasis.

Equations render cleanly; each card ends with a plain-English interpretation.

No dependence on external data; purely explanatory.
